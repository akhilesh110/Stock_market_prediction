Developed a "Stock Market Prediction" project using Django, incorporating logistic regression to forecast stock prices for a specified number of days. The application provides real-time updates on current stock prices and predictive analytics, enabling users to make informed investment decisions. Implemented both backend logic and frontend design to ensure a user-friendly experience.
